# Abstract

This technical document proposes a new blockchain architecture based on Proof of Engagement (PoE) - A proof for verifying engagement among games developed by the developers and the end user, and the passage of time between events, while recording transactions in terms of events related to the movement of digital assets in the Cypher blockchain ecosystem. (PoE) Consensus protocol plays a vital role in the functioning of a blockchain.&#x20;

At present, mainstream consensus protocol includes proof of stake (PoS), proof of work (PoW), and delegated proof of stake (DPoS). PoW, as we know is widely used in virtual currencies, and results in the consumption of energy significantly; proof of stake (PoS) and delegated proof of stake (DPoS) are proposed to reduce the energy waste caused by PoW protocol, but their disadvantage is that they tend to create the Matthew Effect (ME): wherein “the rich get richer.” To balance this unbalanced power of new nodes and elder ones, this technical paper proposes a flexible protocol mechanism called proof of engagement (PoE), based on the user engagement activity and contribution of network nodes by game developers.&#x20;

In our sandbox experiments, we tested the profit changes under PoW, PoS, and PoE. The results illustrate that it is easier for new nodes to accumulate their rewards under a PoE protocol than under PoW or PoS, and reduce the negative impacts of ME.
