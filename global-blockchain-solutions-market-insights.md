# Global Blockchain Solutions Market Insights

Given the potential of the technology and the widespread business interest in the capabilities it can provide, blockchain has become a huge market in its own right, even at this relatively early stage of the technologyâ€™s development. Promising blockchain startup companies regularly accumulate hundreds of millions of dollars of investment in their initial offerings, with particularly successful ones such as EOS raking in multiple billions.

In 2021, global spending on blockchain solutions is projected to reach 6.6 billion dollars. Forecasts suggest that spending on blockchain solutions will continue to grow in the coming years, reaching almost 19 billion U.S. dollars by 2024.

The global blockchain technology market size was valued at USD 10.02 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 87.7% from 2023 to 2030. The market growth can be attributed to the increasing venture capital funding in blockchain technology companies (GRAND VIEW RESEARCH, Blockchain Technology Market Size & Share Report, 2030).
