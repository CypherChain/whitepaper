# Blockchain Gaming Market

> The global blockchain gaming market is projected to grow from USD 4.6 billion in 2022 to RUSD 65.7 billion by 2027 at CAGR of 70.3% during the forecast period. The rise in blockchain game investments is driving the growth of the blockchain game market.

A new study from the United Kingdom revealed that most game studios have already started exploring blockchain technology for their upcoming titles. Commissioned by the blockchain platform Stratis and undertaken by insight agency Opinion, the new research surveyed 197 video game developers in the United States and the United Kingdom. The results showed that 58% of developers are beginning to use blockchain technology, and almost half of the respondents (47%) started incorporating nonfungible tokens (NFT).

The study indicates developersâ€™ confidence in blockchain and NFTs, as two-thirds of studios expect blockchain to become prevalent in the gaming industry within the next two years. While 72% of respondents are considering using blockchain and NFTs in upcoming games, more than half (56%) plan to apply the new tech within 12 months.
