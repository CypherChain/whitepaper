# DAO Participation

Cypher Blockchain is establishing a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). All validators will be automatically enrolled as members of this DAO. The DAO will play a crucial role in decision-making processes, including project grants and fund allocations.

### Cypher Grant Program

As part of our commitment to community involvement, validators will have the opportunity to participate in the Cypher Grant Program. This program allocates 4% of the Total Supply to the Cypher Foundation. Validators, along with the Foundation, will collectively decide on project grants through DAO voting.

### Distribution

The Cypher Foundation and Node Validators will share the 4% allocation in a 30%-70% ratio. This ensures that a significant portion (70%) is earmarked for validators, serving as a strong incentive for their continued participation and contribution to the network.

### Validator Positions

The release of Node Validator positions will occur in multiple phases, allowing for a gradual and controlled onboarding of validators to ensure network stability.
