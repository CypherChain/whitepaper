# Program Overview

#### Maximum Validators

The Cypher Blockchain Validator Program will accommodate a maximum of 2000 validators.

#### TestNet Validator Count

For testing purposes, we are initially launching with 1000 validators on the TestNet.

#### Block Time

The block time for Cypher Blockchain is set at 12 seconds, ensuring efficient processing and validation.

#### Block Rewards

Validators will receive 0.4 CYPHER as a reward for each successfully mined block.

### TestNet Details

To kickstart the program, all validators will be credited with 2000 TestNet CYPHER. It's important to note that these TestNet tokens are non-redeemable and cannot be converted into real-world currency.

### Redemption and MainNet

All rewards accumulated during the TestNet phase will be redeemable into MainNet CYPHER at a 1:1 ratio starting from September 06th, 2024. These MainNet tokens will be 100% unlocked, allowing validators to cash out their rewards.
