# Cypher Blockchain: A Layer 1 Blockchain

This layer 1 Blockchain will be a dedicated consensus to support the development of future AAA-level games for game developers in its ecosystem.  It leverages Proof of Engagement as an alternative to traditional proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms many blockchain networks use. The idea behind proof of engagement is to incentivize users to actively participate in the network by rewarding them for their contributions, rather than simply rewarding them for contributing computing power (as in PoW) or holding a large number of tokens (as in PoS).

One way that proof of engagement could be implemented is by rewarding users for performing useful work on the network, such as validating transactions, participating in governance decisions, or contributing to the development of the network. This could involve the creation of a new token or the use of existing tokens that are earned through participation and can be used to vote on network decisions or reward other users. Proof of engagement has the potential to address some of the challenges associated with traditional consensus mechanisms, such as the high energy consumption of PoW and the centralization risks of PoS.
